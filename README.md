# Learn To Deploy Real-Time Website in AWS (NullClass Project)

This repository showcases a complete, hands-on AWS deployment:
- **EC2** for compute
- **RDS (MySQL)** lab: create DB and connect from EC2
- **S3** for static assets
- **CloudFront** CDN in front of S3
- **Auto Scaling Group (ASG) + Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
- **Route 53 + ACM** for custom domain and HTTPS
- **E-commerce app (EverShop) on EC2** with Node.js (and PostgreSQL inside app module)

ðŸ“„ **Full step-by-step instructions** are included in the attached PDF document in this repo.

## How to Use This Repo
1. **Open the PDF** in this repository for complete, copy-pasteable steps.
2. Follow modules in order (RDS/EC2 â†’ App â†’ S3 â†’ ASG/ALB â†’ Route53/ACM â†’ CloudFront).
3. Use the **README** as an overview; the **PDF** has the detailed commands and screenshots.
